# The Creation of Marathon
The Idea: 
<br> A TV show tracker application with the focus on users adding shows to different categories (Watching, Plan to Watch, Completed, etc). Users should be able to leave a rating on the show (5-star system), as well as a review to go along with it.

The motivation behind it: 
<br> I wanted to create something that involves my interests and what better than an app, that keeps your procrastination organized. I already track my own TV Shows, Anime, Books and Games, so I had a lot of opportunities to choose from. I decided on TV Shows, because it's a continuous airing of episodical series and that means I will have to include some more features in the app, such as "Choose the season and episode you've watched up to this point", so to speak. My references will come from the already existing TV Time website + app, which I use.
